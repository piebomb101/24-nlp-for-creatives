### Indicative class contents
#### Session 11: Introduction to NLP. Text as numbers - James - 10th September
- what is NLP,
- recap on working with text in Python,
- exercise: create a randomised poem,
- stemming and lemmatisation.

#### Session 12: Introduction to Machine Learning. Classification - Marysia - 12th September
- learning from data,
- classification vs regression,
- loss functions,
- pytorch setup,
- train your own classification model (fake news dataset?),
- based on week 6.

#### Session 13: Word vectors and word embedding. Cosine similarity. - Elena & Richa - 17th September
- vector spaces,
- difference vectors,
- cosine similarity,
- exercise: text 2 colour - based on this https://gist.github.com/aparrish/2f562e3737544cf29aaf1af30362f469 . Add colour display with PIL from the RGB values.
- advanced exercise: topic modelling.
- based on week 8 and week 4 - week 4 will need a lot of simplifying.

#### Session 14: Generative text with Markov chains and RNNs. - Elena & Richa - 20th September
- exercise: compare the generative text outputs from a Markov chain and an RNN.
- what is and what isn't Machine Learning
- based on week 5 and week 7 (needs simplifying and shortening). Ideally, there would be 2 text generators based on the same input so that the students can compare.
- in case there is not enough time to go through two notebooks during the lecture - tutors, please walk the students through the RNN notebook!

#### Session 15: Chatbots. - Dan - 23rd September
- lecture about chatbots with historical examples,
- local setup of ChatGPT2 (and llama - llama is optional),
- advanced exercise: transfer learning (if Dan thinks it's viable).
