# NLP SESSION 11 LABS:

## PART 1:

Have a read of this short article:

https://medium.com/@futureanalytica/ethics-in-natural-language-processing-9cfa6ba7c1de

Take a moment to have a quick discussion on the ethical considerations with NLP. Note that this article doesn't have an author listed… and the wording is a bit unusual in places. Is it possible this article on ethics was written by a chatbot? What are the implications of this?


There are an increasingly large number of research papers and academic articles on the ethics surrounding NLP. However it would take a long time to read them all… why not ask https://chatgpt.com/ ? Try the prompt “What are the ethical issues around NLP?”. Does this provide a good answer?



## PART 2:

### Python Poetry Slam:

Take a look at the ‘Cut-up-machine’ notebook (also in this week's labs folder). Run it and get an understanding of how it works. 

Find your own source text to run though the machine. Try different sources and run it as many times as you want to get a poem you like. Then post it into this google docs (you can keep it anonymous) 

Morning group:

Afternoon group:

Once everyone has uploaded a poem why don't we run it again will all of our poems as source text? You could even download it as a .txt and change to notebook to read the file directly (if you’re feeling fancy)





## PART 3:

Open and run the ‘Text as numbers’ notebook. Read through and remind yourself of the processes we discussed in the lecture.

Try downloading and processing some other books from https://www.gutenberg.org/ . See what you can discover about a text just from its most common words. Also think about what problems are arising from the common word lists, that might make them less useful.

What if you wanted to process multiple books at once? What considerations would you have to make?

## BONUS

Take a look at the spongebob-meme-generator and try to compleate the task!!!
